Booze Tracker is a simple restaurant/bar liquor inventory management system.

- Users can create user accounts.
- Booze Tracker incorporates authentication processes to ensure users are authorized to use the application.
- Once a user initially logs in, the user is taken to the "Inventory" page, as this is expected to be the most used aspect of the app.  Here the user inputs current inventory amounts (e.g. amount on hand of each liquor).
- Once an inventory is complete, the user can use the "Report" link to view a report to determine consumption rates of each liquor in inventory and identify the need to order/purchase additional quantities.
- When adding purchased liquor to existing inventory, a user uses the "Add to Inventory" link to record purchases; the app updates the quantity on hand amount in the database. 
- When adding a new liquor that has not previously been in inventory, a user uses the "Add New Liquor" link to add the new liquor and amount to the database.



Future functionality:
- export to excel and/or print report
- visual inventory (thermometer slider bar)
- set par levels for each liquor
- bar code reader
- longer time frame reporting
- identify top and bottom sellers
- automated ordering
